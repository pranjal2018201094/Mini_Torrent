1. Only 1 tracker is up. So, no sinc.
2. Log file is remaining.
3. This functionality is not done properly. "When the application starts, the available .mtorrent files and related files will be checked and
request to add the client name in respective files on tracker server will be sent."
4. Share, Get, Show downloads, remove command is working.
5. By giving exit command, application will close.
6. I have uploaded makefile. In single make command both client and tracker cpp will be built.
   If not working then command is
 
   g++ tracker.cpp -o tracker
   ./tracker <my_tracker_ip>:<my_tracker_port> <other_tracker_ip>:<other_tracker_port> <seederlist_file> <log_file>

   g++ client.cpp -o client -lcrypto -pthread
   â€‹./client <CLIENT_IP>:<UPLOAD_PORT> <TRACKER_IP_1>:<TRACKER_PORT_1> <TRACKER_IP_2>:<TRACKER_PORT_2> <log_file>
